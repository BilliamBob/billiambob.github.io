Here's a blogpost... This sure has been a project. Going through with tutorial code is dangerous, be careful out there! This time I was trying to test if the links worked to the blog posts but it didn't at all!

Remember for to right click and links and "Copy Link Address" to see if the path prefix is really needed.
